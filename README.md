# Data-Analysis-With-Complex-Queries
In this project, I performed advanced data analysis using complex SQL queries to extract actionable insights from structured datasets. The focus was on:  ✅ Nested subqueries ✅ Window functions (e.g., RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LEAD/LAG) ✅ Aggregate functions with GROUP BY &amp; HAVING ✅ CTEs (Common Table Expressions) ✅ Case statements and conditional logic
